# Welcome to CADEC Healthcare API Tutorial

##Introduction

This repository holds the presentation and labs for the healthcare API tutorial at Callista's Developer Conference 2013.

The tutorial is aimed to get started working with the API's presented at http://sdk.minavardkontakter.se .

In the end we will have a mobile enabled HTML/JavaScript app and a Java driven backend/API for our app.

The backend will in turn integrate with the healthcare APIs and will also be a working OAuth 2.0 client that is able to request authorization and retrieve access tokens.
